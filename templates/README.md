# Resume Template Options

I've created three ATS-compatible HTML resume templates with different styles. All are designed to pass ATS systems while looking professional.

**Key Features:**
- Large, light-weight name (28pt, font-weight 300)
- Subtle gray borders (#e0e0e0)

- Clean bullet points with generous spacing

---

### 2. **ats-template-modern.html** - MODERN PROFESSIONAL
- Contemporary design with subtle blue accent color
- Calibri font (modern, professional)

### 3. **ats-template-traditional.html** - TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL

## All Templates Include:

✓ **Single-column layout** (ATS requirement)

✓ **Standard, readable fonts** (ATS requirement)

## How to Choose:

- **Minimal**: If you want to stand out with modern, clean design
- **Modern**: If you want a balance of professional + contemporary (recommended for product management roles)
- **Traditional**: If you want maximum ATS compatibility or applying to conservative industries

## Current Default:

The original `ats-template.html` is still available as a basic starting point. You can replace it with any of these three options, or I can customize further based on your preferences!
