### Q: Tell me about a zero-to-one product you launched.
At Slate Digital, I led the zero-to-one launch of **Virtual Mix Rack (VMR)**, a modular plug-in platform. I defined requirements, scoped the MVP, ran a beta with mixing engineers, and managed launch. Development budget was about **$500K**. VMR became the foundation of the **Everything Bundle subscription**, launched at $24.99/mo or $199/year. In the first year, we signed up **16,000 subscribers**, generating **$3–4M ARR**, more than 6× ROI. Success was validated by trial-to-paid conversions, usage analytics, and customer feedback. Beyond being a flagship product, VMR transformed the business from one-off plug-in sales to a recurring revenue model.

### Q: Walk me through a hardware launch you led.
At Yamaha Guitar Group, I was the product leader for the **Line 6 HX One**, a compact effects pedal with embedded firmware and a librarian app. I defined product requirements, balanced which Helix effects to port, and scoped which parameters were on-pedal vs. in software. I worked with firmware engineers on presets and MIDI, hardware on design tradeoffs, and marketing on positioning HX One as an entry point into the Helix ecosystem. Launched in 2021, it sold over **371K units** and generated **$1M+ revenue**. My role was ensuring hardware, firmware, and software came together as a cohesive product experience.

### Q: Give an example of how you’ve integrated AI into a product.
At APM Music, I led the launch of **AI-powered search** features: natural language search and audio similarity search. I partnered with our AI vendor to define requirements and managed integration into our platform. The main tradeoffs were **recall vs. precision** in NLP queries and **latency vs. accuracy** in audio embeddings. We precomputed catalog embeddings to keep query time under a second. After launch in March 2025, adoption reached **30% of all queries within 3 months**, and average time-to-find music dropped by **~40%**. This validated our decision to prioritize AI search and set the foundation for replacing Solr with AIMS-powered metadata search.

### Q: How do you personally use LLMs in your product work?
A recent example is prototyping a feature called **Unified Search**, which expands our prompt search capabilities. I used **Claude** for research and synthesis, testing different query patterns and clustering user pain points, and **Cursor** to build front-end prototypes quickly. This let me move from idea to working prototype in days instead of weeks. Having both research insights and a demo gave me enough evidence to propose Unified Search as the next roadmap priority. Beyond this project, I also use LLMs to synthesize customer interviews, draft user stories, and spot anomalies in search logs — accelerating my workflow while keeping decisions data-driven.

### Q: How do you measure success for a product launch?
For **Virtual Mix Rack (VMR)**, I defined success across adoption, revenue, and user validation. On a ~$500K development budget, adoption was tracked by usage compared to standalone plug-ins, and VMR quickly became the most-used tool in our catalog. Revenue impact came from its role in launching the **Everything Bundle subscription**, which gained **16,000 subs in year one, generating $3–4M ARR**. User validation came through a beta program, trial-to-paid conversion metrics, and monitoring support and community feedback. Together, these measures confirmed VMR was reaching real users at meaningful scale and delivering the ROI and workflow improvements we targeted.

### Q: Anything else you’d like to add?
That summary looks accurate — though I’ll admit, it’s a little surreal being interviewed by an AI about building products with AI. At least you didn’t make me click on traffic lights first. The only thing I’d add is that I’m motivated by building products that empower people to be more creative and effective. Whether it’s musicians finding their sound faster or learners discovering new tools, I thrive on blending creativity, technology, and measurable impact. That’s the same energy I’d be excited to bring here, especially given your mission to transform education through AI-powered personalization.
