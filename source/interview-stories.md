  - **Recall vs. precision** in NLP queries
  - **Latency vs. accuracy** in audio similarity embeddings
- Implemented pre-computed catalog embeddings to keep query time under one second
- Launched in March 2025
- Worked closely with AI vendors and engineering teams to optimize search results and recommendation accuracy

**Result:**
- **30% adoption rate** within 3 months of launch
- Average time-to-find music dropped by **~40%**
- Increased search engagement by 20% among active users
- Drove 15% increase in music licensing revenue through improved search relevance

**Outcome/Learning:**
- Validated decision to prioritize AI search features
- Set foundation for replacing legacy Solr search with AIMS-powered metadata search
- Learned to balance technical performance (speed) with user experience (accuracy)
- Demonstrated measurable business impact from AI integration (revenue, engagement, efficiency)

**Key Metrics:**
- Launch Date: March 2025
- Adoption: 30% of all queries within 3 months
- Time-to-Find Improvement: ~40%
- Revenue Impact: 15% increase in licensing revenue

### Unified Search Prototype (2025)

**Situation:**
After successful launch of natural language and audio similarity search, we identified an opportunity to create a unified search experience that would consolidate multiple search modes. Needed to rapidly prototype and validate feasibility before committing engineering resources.

**Action:**
- Used **Claude** for research, synthesis, and query pattern testing
- Clustered user pain points and analyzed search log patterns
- Used **Cursor** to build functional front-end prototypes
- Accelerated idea-to-prototype cycle from weeks to days
- Created working demo with both research insights and visual prototype

**Result:**
- Moved from concept to working prototype in days instead of weeks
- Generated sufficient evidence to propose Unified Search as next roadmap priority
- Demonstrated feasibility and user value before significant engineering investment

**Outcome/Learning:**
- LLMs can dramatically accelerate product discovery and validation
- Having both research insights and a working demo strengthens prioritization discussions
- Prototyping tools like Cursor reduce dependency on engineering for early-stage validation
